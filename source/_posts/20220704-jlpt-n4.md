Yesterday I finally took the JLPT N4 exam. It takes me about 100+ hours to study and prepare for this exam this year. I once tried to learn Japanese in my 100 days challenge last year but failed, so this year I set the JLPT N4 as my annual goal.

I don't have Japanese basic, every time I restart my Japanese study program I almost re-learn the 50 sounds Hiragana and Katakana. Online resource has less systematic, so this time I start with 大家學標準日本語, 3 volumes from easy to hard.

During preparation for the JLPT exam, I found I should also take more time to sharpen my English skill, so I decided to write my blog in English. Might not be easy but let's see how I can persist.
