In the past year, I have been learning ceramics with my wife. We have been to several studios to learn from different teachers.

In the beginning, I just wanted to have something to do at night without looking at the screen. But then I found that making ceramics is very interesting.

Making ceramics is not as easy as coding. You cannot have save point or git commit. You have to be very careful and focus on the process.

We then created our own brand "Ching Chun Ceramics", named after our Chinese names. We have an Instagram account [@chingchun.ceramics](https://www.instagram.com/chingchun.ceramics/), and a [website](https://chingchun.tw/).

We will have a booth at Suntec Convention Hal, Singapore, on 2024/04/20 ~ 21. Hope everything goes well.
