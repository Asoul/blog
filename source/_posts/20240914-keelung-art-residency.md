In May 2024, we embarked on an enchanting art residency in Keelung, Taiwan. That was a fantastic experience. The weather was pleasant, the food was delicious, and the people were friendly.

We resided at [SpaceMoor](https://www.instagram.com/spacemoor2023/), a venue owned by [Zhenbin Art](https://www.zhengbinart.com/). They curated many engaging activities, including local tours and forums, which deepened our understanding of the rich local culture.

We explored the diverse landscapes of Keelung, from its mountains to its seas, savoring local cuisine along the way. [Chaojing Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kU6amqKXV4yUJD328) stood out as our favorite among the many places we visited. We delighted in free diving there, marveling at the variety of fish. Swimming alongside these colorful creatures was truly enchanting.

In May, the venue showcased an exhibition by [Chia-ling Chiang](https://www.instagram.com/_chiangchialing_/), a talented Taiwanese artist. Her paintings transformed the entire exhibition space into a captivating fantasy world. Her unique personality and remarkable works left an indelible impression on us.

In June and July, we returned to our hometowns, channeling the inspiration from Keelung into fresh creations. Come August, our turn was to showcase our artwork at the venue. We curated an exhibition called "Ride the Wind, Ride the Wave," which wove together myriad elements of Keelung. Through our pieces, we shared the joy that permeated our residency experience.

During one of our freediving excursions at Chaojing Park in Keelung, we unexpectedly encountered a large school of Ringtail Surgeonfish. We were mesmerized by the sheer power of these fish, which seemed to materialize out of nowhere, startling us with their sudden appearance. In that moment, we could truly feel the raw power of nature combined with a sense of beauty and awe. Inspired by this profound experience, we later created an artwork called "Ride the Wave," aiming to capture the essence of that unforgettable moment.

"Ride the Wind" was inspired by the black kites soaring in the sky of Keelung.

We enjoy eating freshly grilled chikuwa near the harbor in Zhengbin. It seems to be the only store that still sells this delicacy.

We crafted a chikuwa-shaped telescope from clay, through which you can view the chikuwa shop.

We are grateful for the opportunity to participate in this residency. It has been an enriching experience that has profoundly impacted our lives. Our artistic journey continues to unfold...
